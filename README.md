# Retail-Sales-Margin-Prediction (regression)
This project aims to develop a robust regression model to predict the sales margin of different stores based on available data. The goal is to find the best regression model that maximizes the adjusted R-squared (R^2 adj) while minimizing the number of features used in the final model. Techniques such as forward selection and backward selection are explored to identify the most informative features.
### Methodology :

1-Data Exploration and Preprocessing

2-Feature Selection

3-Model Building and Evaluation metric

4-Model Optimization

5-Model Selection
